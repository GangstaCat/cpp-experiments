# C++ Projects
Some small C++ projects that I made to get to know the language. Not that complicated, but just enough to stimulate my monkey brain

## Executables are broken halp
The executables don't work for some reason, i've tried to fix it but it wouldn't work. just install a bunch of crap on your pc and you're good to go


Also this readme is kind of a joke but it's funny
